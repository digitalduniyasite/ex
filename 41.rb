Combined Drills
The final preparation for you is to combine the words drills with the phrase drills. What I want you to do for this drill is this:

Take a phrase card and drill it.
Flip it over and read the sentence, and for each word in the sentence that is in your words drills, get that card.
Drill those words for that sentence.
Keep going until you are bored, then take a break and do it again.
