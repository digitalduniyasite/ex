Research why Ruby added this strange object class and what that means.
Is it possible to use a class like it's an object?

Fill out the animals, fish, and people in this exercise with functions that make them do things. See what happens when functions are in a "base class" like Animal versus in, say, Dog.









    
    Find other people's code and work out all the is-a and has-a relationships.
    Make some new relationships that are arrays and hashes so you can also have "has-many" relationships.
    Do you think there's such thing as an "is-many" relationship? Read about "multiple inheritance," then avoid it if you can.
